# Color-Game

Basic Color Game with Javascript.

How To Play:

1. Choose your difficulty. Easy or Hard.

2. The top header RGB will display a random color. You must select the corresponding RGB color in the squares below.

3. Each square you get wrong will fade away. Try to keep your guesses to a minimum for a real challenge!

4. If the colors displayed are too challenging, you can always hit the "change colors" button on the header.

5. Once you choose the right square, all squares and RBG header will highlight the correct color! Good Luck!
